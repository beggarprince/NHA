New features


Slime

Sprite System
    Need sprites

Limit contols and reactions
    I can't press a button for 1/60th of a second and it causes multiple instances of said button. ATP you're going to cull the enemies accidentally

Camera
    Very hard to look at the entire map moving constantly
    Need to implement a system where the player moves by X/Y values until they are far away enough from the offset that the camera will move
    This will allow the player to move up/down/left/right a bit without moving the camera for precision

Refactors
GameCanvas
    GameCanvas should only be painting, it should not be deciding what gets painted. Needs the logic taken outside of it
Level
    Now that it is singleton class some minor refactoring is necessary
Enemy
    Has some very useful movement code inside of it that would be best moved outside of it so non enemy npcs an utilize it
Camera
    Needs to be changed to a singleton class
kbInput
    Should be a singleton class
Remove Coordinate class
    It just turned out to be a massive headache
