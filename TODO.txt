Gameplay fixes
Player moves too fast
Player camera moves too often, needs a deadzone in the center that will allow the player small movements before the entire camera moves

New features
Water
    Blocks need to be added to handle spawning of water.
    Water needs to head down as to mimic gravity
    Water needs to contain a value like nutrients/mana so if there is not enough room to spread we can stack it and move it as the player digs
    Water creatures

Slime
    Needs Reproduce
    Needs to walk slower

Audio
    Needs to exist

Sprite System
    Need sprites
    Need sprite handler

Limit contols and reactions
    I can't press a button for 1/60th of a second and it causes multiple instances of said button. ATP you're going to cull the enemies accidentally

Camera
    Very hard to look at the entire map moving constantly
    Need to implement a system where the player moves by X/Y values until they are far away enough from the offset that the camera will move
    This will allow the player to move up/down/left/right a bit without moving the camera for precision

Refactors
GameCanvas
    GameCanvas should only be painting, it should not be deciding what gets painted. Needs the logic taken outside of it
Level
    Now that it is singleton class some minor refactoring is necessary
Enemy
    Has some very useful movement code inside of it that would be best moved outside of it so non enemy npcs an utilize it
Camera
    Needs to be changed to a singleton class
kbInput
    Should be a singleton class
Remove Coordinate class
    It just turned out to be a massive headache

Architecture
    Create State within Engine to be able to interrupt the game loop with menus
