Player
    I need to add actions, a simple button click to change tileType will be good for now
Collisions
    Besides the edges of the map, nonexistent atm. Need to be implemented
Slime
    The first enemy type. It simply needs to walk forward until it hits a wall and choose a random direction except the one it came from
        The direction it came from will only be used if it's a dead end and the slime needs to backtrack
