Limit contols and reactions
    I can't press a button for 1/60th of a second and it causes multiple instances of said button. ATP you're going to cull the enemies accidentally

Refactors
GameCanvas
    GameCanvas should only be painting, it should not be deciding what gets painted. Needs the logic taken outside of it
Level
    Now that it is singleton class some minor refactoring is necessary
Dig
    Needs to be taken out of level. Since we have direct access to level.levelData and tileData we don't need it here
Enemy
    Has some very useful movement code inside of it that would be best moved outside of it so non enemy npcs an utilize it
Camera
    Needs to be changed to a singleton class
kbInput
    Should be a singleton class
Remove Coordinate class
    It just turned out to be a massive headache
